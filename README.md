-   README.md: This file :0.

-   main.R: Code for the data collection, model creation, model evaluation, and visualization.

    -   My code isn't normally this disorganized, I promise. With more time, I would probably write a package for an analysis like this. See [my `{xengagement}` package](https://github.com/tonyelhabr/xengagement) for a similar level of analysis bundled together in a package.

-   pbp.parquet: data used for model

    -   I exported this just for reference/reproducibility purposes.

-   coefs.csv: logistic regression coefficients fed into LOESS model

    -   I also exported this just for reference/reproducibility purposes.

-   responses.md: My responses to the questions in the test document.

    -   responses.Rmd is the original source. I just knitted to markdown format. If there is something strange in the markdown format, I blame `{knitr}` :P.

-   various png files: These go along with responses.md. In particular, win_prob_example.png is the visualization requested in question 2.

-   png files in extra/ sub-directory: screenshots of the win probaility models from ESPN, inpredictable, and gambletron2000 for the game noted in question 2.

Thanks for the opportunity to interview. I did this within a 24-hour time span (about 6-8 hours total). I have other work to do (including other take-home interviews), so please respect the fact that I could have done more.
