Player awareness and intangibles are maybe not unexplored concepts--basketball IQ perhaps attempts to quantify this--but I think there could certainly be more research on these things. In particular, I would be interested in studying the concept of "scanning", an action where a player visually gathers information by looking away from the ball before subsequently engaging with the ball. The most recent kind of study that I know of on scanning found that Premier League midfielders tend to complete passes at a higher rate if they scan before receiving the ball and making the pass:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7573254/. I'm curious if we would find the same in basketball. If so, it could be something that is emphasized more and more in practice (if it isn't already).
